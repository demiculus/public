## Research System Update 2

1. I've removed reddit/github/cmc columns thus the main spread sheet is cleaner. http://prntscr.com/jnvqi0

2. We have decreased the minimum amount of coins a researcher should look per week from 2 to 1. The researcher is encouraged to check out more coins but not necessary.

3. We've added 3 coins every researcher is recommended to dive in before researching other coins. These coins will teach the fundamentals of a good coin thus it'll be easier to understand what is good and what is not.

  - Monero - Easy to understand, how maximum privacy works. All privacy coins are a fork of eachother
  - Stellar - BFT system. It is the fastest and the best out there.
  - Nebulas - Uses dPoS. Understanding is really hard and needs to be dived deep.
  This explains that it is not google but an appstore. https://www.reddit.com/r/nebulas/comments/7rwllx/nebulas_technical_white_paper_review_january_20/ "

4. Added this to FAQ: What kind of coins are we looking for? We are looking for legit coins. Not pump & dumps or short term coins. Your points should be given to the long term success of the coin.

5. Weekly meetings in FAQ has been changed from

  What is weekly coin meetings & how to attend them?	We hold weekly meetings about the coins we have researched that week. It will be hosted in our hacker house. Those who have filled their quota for 2 weeks are invited.
