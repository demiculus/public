|Question|Answer|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|How can someone beome a researcher?|	They can be referred or they can apply. Demi should be contacted. They will need to go through a 2 week trial period.|
|What are the qualifications you seek in a researcher?|- They should already be researching coins on their own.<br>- Their english level should be advanced<br>- They have a past record of making good investment decisions.|
|How is the researcher trial period done?|They will research coins, if they fill their quota & are able to analyze coins correctly for 2 weeks they will be accepted as a full fledged researcher.|
|What is researcher quota?|The minimum amount of coin we want researchers to check in detail is 1 per week. Note that these coins should be the ones the algorithm has provided not requested coins.|
|Is there a private telegram/discord group for researchers?|Yes, if the researcher fills their quota the first 2 weeks they will be invited.|
|What is weekly coin meetings & how to attend them?|We hold weekly meetings about the coins we have researched that week. It will be hosted in our hacker house. Those who have filled their quota for 2 weeks are invited.|
|How can I see old coin decisions & notes?|If you be valuable to our community for 1 month we will share our complete historical data with you.|
|Is there a way we can lose access to historical data?|If you stop being a part of the community, stop researches, attending meetings etc. you will lose your access.|
|How are the main coins decided?|They are generated algorithmically. Since the algorthm keeps evolving and gets more complicated its hard to talk about the details.|
|How many researchers check each coin?|Each coin is checked by minimum of 3 researchers.|
|Can I check a coin which isn't in the priority list?|Yes, you can request a coin from the Request Coin sheet. and that coin will be added to Main sheet.|
|Where do I ask any extra question?|You can ask Demi. Telegram: demiculus|
|What type of content should researchers write to notes?|They should write<br>- TLDRs<br>- Important Facts<br>- Their own opinions/thoughts<br>- Their questions about the investment/tech/..<br>- Their conclusion|
|How should I be researching the coins?|You may research them in any way you like,<br>- you may do a superficial analysis & look at the most obvious parts of the coin thus you will get to check a lot of coins in a short time.<br>or<br>- you may do an in depth analysis thus you will go deeper and check low amount of coins in the same time.<br>or<br>- you may do anything in between. We all have different styles of checking coins.<br>The way some of our researchers check is; They check out the coin, lets say the coin mentions they do oracles, then the researchers search on youtube 'what is oracle', 'how does it work', 'when will it work', 'why does it not work in 2017' etc until understanding what that concept is and how it works. Then going back to the coin and cointinue'in researching. If it is needed we spend 5-10 hours checking only a single coin (learning a lot of concepts). This is why we don't expect our researchers to check 10s of coins every week.<br>But we also do need some people to check a lot of coins in a short amount of time. And everything in between these 2 styles.|
